        <p>I am a mechanical designer and engineer with over ten years of experience in product development across a number of different industries.</p>
        <p class="onePointFive"></p>
        <p>In the spring of 2019, I opted to step away from my career to do some significant life-reevaluation. In the fifteen months since then, I have lost 85 pounds, taught myself how to code websites (this one included), and moved to a new city in a new state. Recently I decided that I am finally ready to look for new work again, now with a more consistent personal philosophy and a healthier approach to life.</p>
        
        <p class="onePointFive"></p>
        <p>I particularly enjoy working on the early stages of the development of a product, when the thing is still taking shape. In that phase, there's a need for exploration and creativity that very much appeals to me.</p>
        <p class="onePointFive"></p>
        <p>I like to be as hands-on as possible when it comes to making prototypes and early versions of products. I have always believed that the more you know about the limits and capabilities of the machines and materials you're working with, the better you'll be at using them to get the results you want. To that end, I have personally operated manual mills and lathes, CNC mills, 3D printers, and laser cutters, to name a few. The projects profiled on this website demonstrate some of the uses I've put those machines to.</p>

            <p>When not at work, I'm a doting uncle to three nephews, a niece, and a couple of "fake nieces" (the children of a good friend from college).</p>
            <p class="onePointFive"></p>
            <p>I'm also a fan of unusual human-powered vehicles, a casual (<i>very</i> casual) videogamer, and an amateur escape-room enthusiast.</p>
