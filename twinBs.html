        <h2>Inception</h2>
        <p>This was a personal project to make a gift for my grandmother and her twin sister.  I also turned it into a one-time experience for my whole family to participate in, including my then-three-year-old nephew, who was just getting into jigsaw puzzles.</p>

        <h2>Concept</h2>
        <p>A jigsaw-type puzzle whose completed form could serve as the sign on the front door of a small family business.  My grandmother and her identical twin sister, whose names both begin with the letter B, had been talking for years about starting a little curiosity shop in their retirement.  The name they settled upon for that shop was "Twin B's Curiosities".</p>

        <table>
          <tr class="toolsMaterials">
            <td>
              <h2 class="lefty">Tools</h2>
              <ul>
                <li class="simpleList">SolidWorks</li>
                <li class="simpleList">Objet30 Pro 3D Printer</li>
              </ul>
            </td>
            <td>
              <h2 class="lefty">Materials</h2>
              <ul>
                <li class="simpleList">UV-curable liquid photopolymers DurusWhite and <br>VeroBlack (Both were due to expire before they could <br>be used up, and were hence available for me to use.)</li>
              </ul>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Draw original bee logo</li>
          <img src="images/p9_twinbs_CAD1.png" alt="">
          <li>Design interlock features</li>
          <img src="images/p9_twinbs_CAD2.jpg" alt="">
          <li>Experiment to evaluate the tolerances of features produced by the 3D printer.</li>
          <p>These results were used to determine final size tweaks on the individual piece parts so that they would fit together with just the right feel.</p>
          <li>Print parts.</li>
          <p></p>
          <li>Clean off support material with water blaster.</li>
          <p>With that, the object was created, and required only delivery and final assembly -- the stages of the process that would transform this project into a shared experience.</p>
          <li>Delivery</li>
          <p>I gift-wrapped the pieces individually, addressing each to various members of my family.  This was at Christmastime, which my family celebrates as a gift-giving holiday, despite not all being Christian.  Each piece was opened one at a time by different family members over the course of a long morning of gift exchanges.  I told them that the pieces would come together to form a gift for two of the people present, but never said which two.</p>
          <li>Assembly</li>
          <p>When the pieces were all unwrapped, we took a break from the gift exchange and gathered around a table.  There, four generations of my family -- led, I like to think, by my then-three-year-old nephew -- together solved the puzzle, revealing the gift for our two eldest family members.</p>

        </ol>

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>This project is complete as it stands.  They framed the puzzle, and it will finally serve its first use as a business sign later this year.  I told my grandmother and my great aunt that I would be happy to help them with design, logo, and signage support for their curiosity shop at any time.</p>
